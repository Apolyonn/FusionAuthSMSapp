#App to test SMS login

This project is an example Node.js application that illustrates how to integrate with FusionAuth using the Authorization Code grant.

This assumes you already have a running FusionAuth instance, user and application running locally. If you don't, please see the [5-Minute Setup Guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide) to do so.


* run `npm install`
* `npm start`

Go to http://localhost:3000/ and login with the previously created user.

You should see 'Hello <name>'

You should be able to logout as well.
